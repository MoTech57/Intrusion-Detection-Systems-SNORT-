# üöîSnort Network Detection Lab ‚Äî Nmap Detection & SOC Response (Ubuntu + Kali)

## üìñ Description  
## This lab shows how to deploy and operate Snort on an Ubuntu sensor to detect host and network scanning performed from a Kali attacker VM. The focus is on:
- A **Windows Server Domain Controller** and a **Windows test machine** were joined under the domain `MyDFIR.local`.  
- Authentication events were forwarded to **Splunk** on an **Ubuntu server**.  
- **Splunk dashboards** and **alerts** were configured to detect suspicious login attempts.  
- Automated **Shuffle playbooks** sent notifications to SOC analysts via **Slack** and **email**, with the option to disable compromised accounts.  

This simulates how enterprise SOCs monitor Active Directory, investigate alerts, and respond to threats in real time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Languages and Utilities Used  

- PowerShell  
- Splunk  
- Shuffle (SOAR automation)  
- Slack (SOC notifications)  
- SSH (remote access)  
- Remote Desktop Client  
- Linux networking utilities (ping, curl, etc.)  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Environments Used  

- Windows Server (Active Directory Domain Controller)  
- Windows 10 (Test Machine)  
- Ubuntu Server (Splunk)  
- Vultr Cloud Hosting

## üîÑ Workflow  

**Install Snort on the Ubuntu sensor and verify installation.:**

**Use ip a or ifconfig to confirm the sensor sees the lab network and target IPs.:**

**Use a text editor to edit configuration(Snort.conf) if error occurs, give rwx permissions:**

**Once in snort.conf Set HOME_NET to network IP range, and review enabled rules:**

**From the Kali VM, run Nmap scans to generate reconnaissance telemetry:**

**Observe Snort alerts a Nmap scan is happening, "leaking information", Use tcpdump -w /tmp/attack_capture.pcap host <attacker-ip> and host <target-ip> or tshark to save packet captures for analyst review:**
