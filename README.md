# üñ•Ô∏è Active Directory Monitoring Lab üñ•Ô∏è  

## üìñ Description  
This lab demonstrates **Active Directory security monitoring** and **incident response** using **Splunk** and **SOAR automation (Shuffle)**.  

- A **Windows Server Domain Controller** and a **Windows test machine** were joined under the domain `MyDFIR.local`.  
- Authentication events were forwarded to **Splunk** on an **Ubuntu server**.  
- **Splunk dashboards** and **alerts** were configured to detect suspicious login attempts.  
- Automated **Shuffle playbooks** sent notifications to SOC analysts via **Slack** and **email**, with the option to disable compromised accounts.  

This simulates how enterprise SOCs monitor Active Directory, investigate alerts, and respond to threats in real time.
